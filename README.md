# Sudoku

This is a Sudoku game with a GUI. 
Features:
* Generates a random solvable board on startup
* Checks if your solution is correct
* Can attempt to solve the board based on it's current state (Initial board plus any entries you may have made) and shows either the solution or that it is unsolvable
* Input verification. I.e. If you enter illegal characters liek alphabets, they get reverted to a zero.
* Generate new boards after one board is solved
